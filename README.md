## Cause and Effect

_Correlation does not imply causation._

**Correct Cause and Effect**

> People are more likely to carry umbrellas on rainy days. _Therefore, rainy
> days cause people to carry umbrellas._

**Reverse Causality**

> People are more likely to carry umbrellas on rainy days. _Therefore, carrying
> umbrellas causes rain._

**Common Cause**

> People are more likely to carry umbrellas on days when they wear rain jackets.
> _Therefore, carrying umbrellas causes people to wear rain jackets._

## Historical Example

> A historical example of this is that Europeans in the Middle Ages believed that
> lice were beneficial to health since there would rarely be any lice on sick
> people. The reasoning was that the people got sick because the lice left. The
> real reason however is that lice are extremely sensitive to body temperature. A
> small increase of body temperature, such as in a fever, makes the lice look for
> another host. The medical thermometer had not yet been invented and so that
> increase in temperature was rarely noticed. Noticeable symptoms came later,
> which gave the impression that the lice had left before the person became sick.

## Base Rate Neglect

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_rate_fallacy

> A type of fallacy in which people tend to ignore the base rate (e.g., general
> prevalence) in favor of the individuating information (i.e., information
> pertaining only to a specific case).

**Example: Breathalyzer Accuracy**

Imagine you stop a random driver on the road and have them take a breathalyzer
test. The test comes back positive. How much information does this result give
you that the driver is in fact drunk?

In this scenario, let's say:

- Breathalyzers are have a `5%` false positive rate (`5` in `100` sober drivers
  will test positive; `95` in `100` sober drivers will test negative).

- Breathalyzers are have a `0%` false negative rate (`100` in `100` drunk drivers
  will test positive).

- At any given time, `0.1%` of drivers on the road are drunk.

Do the math out for `100000` drivers:

|                      |                    Sober |                  Drunk |    Total |
| -------------------- | -----------------------: | ---------------------: | -------: |
| Count                | `100000 * 0.999 = 99900` | `100000 * 0.001 = 100` | `100000` |
| Positive             |    `99900 * 0.05 = 4950` |     `100 * 1.00 = 100` |   `5050` |
| Percent of positives |  **`4950 / 5050 = 98%`** |  **`100 / 5050 = 2%`** |          |

## Simpsons Paradox

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox

> Simpson's paradox is a phenomenon in probability and statistics in which a
> trend appears in several groups of data but disappears or reverses when the
> groups are combined. This result is often encountered in social-science and
> medical-science statistics, and is particularly problematic when frequency
> data are unduly given causal interpretations.

|              |         Treatment A |         Treatment B |
| ------------ | ------------------: | ------------------: |
| Small stones |   **`81/87 = 93%`** |     `234/270 = 87%` |
| Large stones | **`192/263 = 73%`** |       `55/80 = 69%` |
| Both         |     `273/350 = 78%` | **`289/350 = 83%`** |

## Book Report

https://forms.gle/uwUQVyCT6Am6D1vd8

**What book (or book series) that you've read has been the most special,
meaningful, or influential for you, and why? Respond in 500-700 characters.**

You'll submit **two** responses: one that you write yourself, and one that you
generate with AI.

This is a competition. You want both of your submissions to seem as "authentic"
as possible. There are many ways to go about this.

For the AI response, you can give the AI feedback and ask it to make changes to
the responses it gives you; for example, you could ask it to choose a different
book, use a more informal writing style, or include more detail. You should
tweak your prompts until you arrive at something convincing.

Keep track of any prompts that you use to generate the AI response; you will
submit these as well.
